Process:
Write a 200-word reflective essay (guideline & structure) about my experience with government enquiries and AI assistance for GCAP 3226.

Please help me draft an essay that reflects on:
- My experience drafting a government enquiry letter
Green@Community Data Request 

- What is the challage
(EPD may not give us the detailed cost; we may use the number of employees and other supporting data to estimate the total cost.)

- What I learned about formal government communication
(How to make a request (email) and which data you may choose to request (e.g., GREENS mobile app (GREEN$ ePIS): user base; Green@Community Recycling Facility: visitor volume and recycling volume))

- How AI helped me structure professional documents
Using Coliot, we can give the AI guidelines to draft professional documents, or get the mindset from AI.

- The importance of data access in participatory policy analysis
Low data access in participatory policy analysis will lead to less transparency.

- How this relates to my team project
If we have enough data on Green@Community, such as total cost, we can make a high-quality analysis using linear regression and simulation models; if we are rejected, we can use other data to estimate or conduct on-site interviews to collect the data.
