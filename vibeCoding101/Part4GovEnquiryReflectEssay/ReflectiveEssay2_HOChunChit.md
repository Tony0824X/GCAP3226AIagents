Drafting the **Green@Community Data Request** was my first experience composing a **government enquiry**. I helped frame the purpose, specify the most recent three full calendar years, and structure polite requests for partial datasets when complete series were unavailable. The process required a respectful tone, clear definitions, and careful scoping to help officials locate data efficiently. Writing to the **Environmental Protection Department** taught me to anchor each request to **academic use** and the **public interest**, while acknowledging constraints and offering flexible formats such as **CSV**, **Excel**, or **API**.

<h4 style="text-align:left; margin-left:20px;">Challenges & Mitigations</h4>

The hardest part was that **EPD** might not disclose **operating costs**. I prepared alternatives, such as estimating total costs from staffing counts and other support data. Formal communication also means naming exactly which fields we need. I highlighted the **GREENS** mobile app, **GREEN$**, and **ePIS** user-base and activity metrics; facility visitor counts; and **recycling volumes** by facility type and district. **AI** improved my drafting discipline. Using **Coliot**, I supplied guidelines and received clean sections, headings, and a professional mindset for revisions.

<h4 style="text-align:left; margin-left:20px;">Why This Matters</h4>

This matters for our **Group 5** project on **cost-effectiveness**. Robust data access enables participatory policy analysis and greater **transparency**. With full data, we can build **linear regression** and **simulation models**. If requests are rejected, we can triangulate with staffing and facility data, estimate **unit costs**, and run **on-site interviews** to validate assumptions.
